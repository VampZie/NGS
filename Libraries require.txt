Libraries required
			gunzip - for unzip ( sudo apt install gzip )
			sra-toolkit - for downloading datasets exclusive from NCBI
			fastqc - Quality check ( sudo apt install fastqc )
			fastp - trimming the adaptors if the fastqc report isn't clear the quality line ( sudo apt install fastp )
			hisat2 / star - Fast and memory-efficient. Good for large genomes alinger ( sudo apt install hisat2 ) / More accurate and faster for spliced alignments (heavier on memory).
			samtools - manipulating high-throughput sequencing data in SAM, BAM, and CRAM formats.
			build-essential zlib1g-dev - for depandancies of other libraries
			for subreads downlaad form the provided link witht he lastest verison ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/subread/files/ ) -- extraxt using tar > cd to src > make -f MakeFiles.Linux > move the files to bashrc to make it run from anywhere
