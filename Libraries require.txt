Libraries required
			gunzip - for unzip ( sudo apt install gzip )
			sra-toolkit - for downloading datasets exclusive from NCBI
			fastqc - Quality check ( sudo apt install fastqc )
			fastp - trimming the adaptors if the fastqc report isn't clear the quality line ( sudo apt install fastp )
			hisat2 / star - Fast and memory-efficient. Good for large genomes alinger ( sudo apt install hisat2 ) / More accurate and faster for spliced alignments (heavier on memory).
			samtools - manipulating high-throughput sequencing data in SAM, BAM, and CRAM formats.
